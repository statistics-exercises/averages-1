# (revision) Plotting random variables

We will start this exercise with some revision of the material that we have covered in previous exercises.  __To complete this first exercise you should generate 100 uniform random variables that lie between 0 and 1.__  These variables should be stored in the NumPy array called `random_variables`.  

As you can see, I have written code that will plot your 100 uniform random variables.  To get this code to work, however, you will need to write a second list called `indices` that contains a numerical index for each of the variables in `random_variables`.  The first of these indices should be equal to one, the second should be equal to two, the third should be three and so on.
